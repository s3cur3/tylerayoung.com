</style>

Say you want to build a tool to handle translating a user interface. Whether in a native app or on the web, this seems like it should be pretty simple. You'll each string in your UI, run it through a function that looks that string up in the user's preferred language, and you're done.

Here's a first pass:

```js
button.label = translate("Click here");
```

Resulting in something like:

> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mb-1">Click here</button> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mb-1">Klicke hier</button> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mb-1">„Åì„Åì„Çí„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„ÇØ</button> (etc.)<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-return">¬π</a>

Perfect translation for every language, solved! (Assuming our translators are good, at least.)

That is, well, until we start to use it a bit...

## Prologue: How hard could this be?

Suppose we laid out a title bar with a button in a single line. On phones, that means we're limited to the device width for certain layouts. This works fine in English:

<blockquote>
<div style="width: 320px; padding: 1rem; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden" class="rounded bg-blue-100">
<span class="text-xl text-default" style="font-style: normal;">Welcome to our app!</span> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded ml-8">FAQ</button>
</div>
</blockquote>

It even works in German, where the translation of FAQ is... "FAQ." üòÑ

But what happens in Spanish?

<blockquote>
<div style="width: 320px; padding: 1rem; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden" class="rounded bg-blue-100">
<span class="text-xl text-default" style="font-style: normal;">Bienvenido a nuestra aplicaci√≥n</span> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded ml-8">Preguntas frecuentes</button>
</div>
</blockquote>

Gah! Our FAQ button disappeared. Okay, let's shorten the title to just "welcome" in Spanish:

<blockquote>
<div style="width: 320px; padding: 1rem; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden" class="rounded bg-blue-100">
<span class="text-xl text-default" style="font-style: normal;">Bienvenidos</span> <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded ml-8">Preguntas frecuentes</button>
</div>
</blockquote>

This brings us to Hard Lesson #1, even before we encounter challenges with translation itself:

> Assume every layout will need to wrap.<a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-2-return">¬≤</a>

This is a good practice for other reasons, too---once you've gone through the work of making sure your layouts can handle strings of much greater lengths, it becomes way easier to also support larger base text sizes. Age 40 comes for us all, and being able to increase text size is one of the most commonly used accessibility features.

## Context matters... it super, duper matters.

So we fixed our layouts, and we rolled out our first round of translations to much fanfare. But now we're starting to hear complaints from users that the translations aren't very good. That can't be, though! All our translations were vetted by independent (and expensive) _reverse_ translation as well, so we could verify on the round trip that they meant the same thing.

What on earth could have happened?

Consider this scenario (unfortunately inspired by real translation mishaps I have perpetrated):

Like many apps, we have a button in the upper left that says "< Back" that returns you to the previous screen. We also have a screen in our application that shows you four different views of a landmark: left, right, front, and (importantly) back.

Here's what our translators saw:

```
. . .
Landmark Name=
Height=
Width=
Left=
Right=
Front=
Back=
. . .
```

Our tool that generates the strings to be translated tries to be smart and save us money, so it will only spit out "Back=" once.

The problem is that when we say "Back" as in "view from the back," that's a very different meaning from "go back to the previous screen." As an English speaker, the difference is quite subtle, but here's what our German translator supplied us:

```
. . .
Left=Von links
Right=Von rechts
Front=Von vorne
Back=Von hinten
. . .
```

The reverse translation back to English will be fine to a casual scan---something like "From the left," "from the right," "from the front," and "from behind." But oh! "From behind" is *not* a good translation of our Back *button*!

It gets worse. In the context of different visualizations of something, the German "von hinten" is innocuous. On its own, it has, shall we say, *erotic* connotations.

Well, that's Hard Lesson #2:

> Supplying translations without context, you might accidentally label your back button "Doggy style." ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting fancy: Numeric substitutions

Translation is at its easiest when you have a set of totally static strings (though as we've seen, even that is easy to screw up). By sheer volume, those static strings make up the majority of UIs, but there will also be cases where we need to substitute dynamically-generated values into the text. After all, we don't really want to pay to individually translate "1 result," "2 results," "3 results," "4 results," . . .

As a first pass, we might build an API like this:

```js
label.text = results.length === 0 ?
  translate("No results") :
  translate("%d results", results.length);
```

That won't do even in English though---we need a singular version so we don't end up saying "1 results." Okay, we can do that!

```js
label.text = results.length === 0 ?
  translate("No results") :
  translatePlural("%d result",
                  "%d results",
                  results.length);
```

Now we have a special translation for the zero, singular, and plural forms. Great!

But oh, it turns out a number of languages (most notably Arabic) have special forms for exactly two of a thing (the [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)). I guess if we want  to extend our API to support those, we could do something like:

```js
label.text = results.length === 0 ?
  translate("No results") :
  translatePlural("%d result",
                  "%d results",
                  "%d results",
                  results.length);
```

Oof. That's not awesome.

That's when you learn about the [paucal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number#Paucal), most notably found in Russian and Polish. These languages have different grammatical rules for "few" (2-4 things) versus "many" (5+).

Rather than extending the API of `translatePlural()` to support all these cases, I think the best thing you can do is make the _translator_ side of ths system support creating these rules.

That brings us to Hard Lesson #3:

> There are no universal rules about how plural forms operate. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Riding into the danger zone: Other substitutions

While numbers are perhaps the most common dynamic substitution to make, they're far from the only one you'll need. Consider this sentence:

> We've sent a confirmation code to jdoe@hotmail.com.

If you've gotten this far, you're surely appreciating that we can't just do this:

```js
message =
  translate("We've sent a confirmation code to ")
   + user.email;
```

We need to support string substitutions. As a first pass, you probably try something like the `printf()` format specifiers, so you can write:

```js
translate(
  "We've sent a confirmation code to %s",
  user.email
);
```

That works fine, and it allows the translators the freedom to move the substitution around within the phrase. If the language's grammar would put the email somewhere in the middle, as in German, the translation might look like this:

> Wir haben einen Best√§tigungscode an jdoe@hotmail.com gesendet.

What happens, though, when you have two or more substitutions to make? Suppose we want to translate the string:

> You sent payment 1 of 5

Naively, we might try:

```js
translate(
  "You sent payment %d of %d",
  payment,
  totalPayments
)
```

The problem with the `printf()`-style substitution is that it isn't specific enough; the order of the substitutions is fixed. In some languages (I think Japanese is one of them, but don't quote me on that), the grammatical way to render this amounts to "You sent, of the 5 payments, payment number 1."

Hard Lesson #4:

> You need to support reordering any substitutions anywhere in the phrase.

With that in mind, we could have a format specifier that requires "named" substitutions like this:

> You sent payment %payment number% of %total payments%.

Then translators can reorder the substitutions as needed.

## The rabbit hole goes deeper

This is an incomplete look at the challenges of translation (and the broader concern of [localization](https://lingohub.com/academy/glossary/translation-vs-localization)). Right-to-left languages present a whole new category of UI framework challenges. Then there are different cases for different substitution forms (e.g., Mozilla's Fluent [allows](https://blog.mozilla.org/l10n/2019/04/11/implementing-fluent-in-a-localization-tool/#attachment_1377) you to translate substituted words like brand names differently for the nominative versus genitive case). Your sentence with substitutions might need to account for the grammatical gender of the words being substituted. 

This stuff is complicated. But I hope this post has been useful in opening your eyes at how many mistaken ideas we have about the structure of language, and maybe help you think twice before you assume other languages will work like English.

They note that the problem is exacerbated with short English strings, both because they tend to have a higher expansion factor than longer strings post-translation and because we tend to design for them being short.
