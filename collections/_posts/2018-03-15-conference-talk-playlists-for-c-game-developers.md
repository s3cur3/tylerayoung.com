I’ve put together a number of conference talk playlists for my own “professional development.” This is a list curated by going through _hundreds_ of talks in the [GDC](https://www.gdcvault.com) and [CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg) archives.

I’ve tried to keep overlap between lists to a minimum. I’ve not watched everything (erm… obviously!), but in cases where I _have_ watched a talk, I’ve only left it on the list if I actually got something out of it.

*   **General C++ Development**
    *   [C++ Performance](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Dba4GxNAuuBr_VpyODrLgDrrP_2wc9N)

    *   [Misc. C++ Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Dba4GxNAutSmuBAdVitcIN2u6FaMbVm) (stuff that doesn’t really fit in the above buckets)
