Last week I [soft-launched SleepEasy to people on my early access list](https://www.sleepeasy.app/2023/11/30/early-access-and-roadmap/). I had a small email list of about 30 people who had signed up because they wanted SleepEasy to monitor their domain, and in the course of talking about the early access launch, another 10 or so people joined that list.

So, how did it go? How many people signed up?

Keep in mind, I was launching to an intentionally small group, because I wanted to shake out any issues before opening it up to a wider field. I figured I'd be lucky to get 5-10 signups.

Well, out of those 40 or so people...

[Drumroll, please! 🥁 🥁 🥁]

Zero signed up. Not one.

[Womp wooooooooooomp.]



I was initially _extremely_ discouraged. As days passed with no interest, I started questioning whether the product had any future at all, and 


> You signed up for the SleepEasy early access list a week or so ago, but I haven't heard back from you about getting started monitoring your web site.
>
> I'm guessing SleepEasy isn't a good fit for you? Maybe it's missing something, or just not solving an important problem?
>
> I'd *massively* appreciate any feedback you have... the harsher the better (I promise you can't hurt my feelings). Plus, I certainly don't want to keep sending you emails if you're not interested any more. I haaaaate receiving junk mail, and I don't want to inflict that on anybody else.

> Anyway, let me know!
