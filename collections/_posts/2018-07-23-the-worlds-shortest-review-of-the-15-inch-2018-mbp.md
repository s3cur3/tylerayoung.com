I just upgraded from a 2015 Retina MacBook Pro to the new 6-core 2018 model.

I had a lot of trepidation about upgrading, considering all the reviews trashing the “butterfly” keyboard since its introduction (Marco Arment went so far as to say the my old 2015 MBP [might never be surpassed](https://marco.org/2017/11/14/best-laptop-ever)), plus the recent [FUD](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=15&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjnnL-V0bXcAhVl2oMKHX6TBl4QFjAOegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2018%2F07%2F17%2Fcore-i9-chip-macbook-pro-throttling%2F&usg=AOvVaw0MuEMYcL6hq8ifY53gxy33) surrounding thermal throttling in the 6-core model. (Edit: Apparently throttling has been [fixed](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/24/2018-macbook-pro-throttling-bug-fix/).)

Here are my thoughts on the change, obviously taken from the perspective of using this for full-time software development:

*   Oh my God, the power. I will _never_ buy another laptop with fewer than 6 cores. The only metric I care about: full recompile times on X-Plane’s large C++ project dropped by about 40% compared to the 2015 model. (!!!)
*   Complaints about thermal throttling are massively overblown (probably subject to specific CPU+GPU-intensive workloads). I benchmarked 10 recompiles in a row and didn’t see any throttling.
*   The level of hardware engineering here is _still_ unparalleled. It’s thinner than the 2015 model, prettier, and _may_ have better battery life. (An apples-to-apples comparison with my 2015 model is no longer possible, of course.)
    *   Related: The screen is (unbelievably) both easier to open with one hand _and_ more stable when open. (Nothing irritates me more than a laptop’s screen shaking as I use it.)
*   USB-C is both great and terrible. (Charge from any port? Fantastic! Need an adapter for “old” USB? Ugh.) Obviously this will alleviate itself over time as more stuff goes “natively” USB-C. I may end up buying a Lightning-to-USB-C cable so that my phone can use the same power adapter as the laptop, which would be nice. For now, [this travel-sized hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078JWXY1T/) helps a lot.
*   The über-polarizing keyboard takes some getting used to, but I like it. (Which surprised me, because based on reviews, I expected to either _love_ it or hate it.)
*   The Touch Bar is a useless gimmick if you’re the kind of person who obsessively memorizes keyboard shortcuts (which I am!). I’d much rather have a physical Escape key, but [remapping Caps Lock to Escape works fine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x/40254864#40254864).
*   Touch ID on the keyboard is “just” fine. I use it, but I wouldn’t miss it if it weren’t there.
*   The oversized trackpad is also “just” fine. It’s smart enough not to be activated by resting my palms on it when typing, but having to go _alllllllll_ the way to the lower right to activate a right-click is a bit annoying.

Overall, it’s still the best laptop I’ve ever owned, hands down—just like my 2015 model was when I bought it.

YMMV.
