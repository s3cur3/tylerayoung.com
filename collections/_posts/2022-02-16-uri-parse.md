TIL the difference between [`URIâ€‹.new/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/URI.html#new/1) and [`URI.parse/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/URI.html#parse/1) in Elixir 1.13.

- `new/1` does a bunch of validation to ensure the URI is within spec
- `parse/1` does no validation at all

Lots of URIs in the wild are *technically* invalid, but web browsers handle them just fine.

Obviously `URI.parse/1` is somewhat unsafe, so in our app we've combined it with some hand-rolled validation to ensure the URI is vaguely URL-like:

- It has a scheme of HTTP or HTTPS
- The authority contains a plausible TLD
