This is the talk I gave at ElixirConf 2025, titled "Cat and Mouse: Challenges in Adversarial Web Scraping."

Description:

> The time comes in every developer’s career when they need to scrape a web page. If you’re lucky, a simple HTTP request gets you what you need, or maybe you have to spoof some browser headers. But if that’s not enough, what can you do?
>
> And from the other side, as a site operator, how can you prevent your site from being scraped by any script kiddie who knows what a user agent is?
>
> In this talk, we’ll explore the dark art of scraping the web from both perspectives: the bots, and the services that try to confound them. We’ll look at a number of techniques for detecting non-human traffic, and show how a respectful, ethical scraper might get around them. (Hint: You can’t use OTP’s built-in HTTP stack for this!) We’ll also look at the gold standard for bot detection, and test the limits for how sites can prevent automated access.
