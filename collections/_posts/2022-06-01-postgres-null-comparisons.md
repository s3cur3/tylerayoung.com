summary: Say you want to build a tool to handle translating a user interface. Whether in a native app or on the web, this seems like it should be pretty simple. You'll take each string in your UI, run it through a function that looks the string up in the user's preferred language, and you're done.

TIL in Postgres, if you do this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM things WHERE property NOT IN ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
```

â€¦it won't take rows where `property` was `NULL`. 

Surprising, but under the hood, it's trying to do an equality comparison, which never works on `NULL`.
