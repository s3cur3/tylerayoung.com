These are my notes on an interview with James Clear: [Designing Your Environment to Shape Your Behavior](http://www.fullstackradio.com/96)

*   Improving habits basically means overcoming your orientation toward immediate gratification to instead improve delayed returns.
*   To create habits that stick, you need to:
    *   Make it obvious
        *   This is the cue/trigger to remind you to do the thing
        *   Design your office/home/desk/etc. to encourage the habit you want
        *   E.g., don’t hide your fruit & vegetables in the crisper drawer, put them on the counter!
    *   Make it attractive (the more attractive it is, the more you crave doing it)
    *   Make it easy (the lower friction it is, the better)
    *   Make it satisfying (he more satisfying it is, the more you want to repeat it)
*   The goal of doing these is to _remove willpower_ from the equation
    *   People who are successful in maintaining good habits are the ones who do _not_ face temptations… not the ones who are magically more strong-willed
    *   Willpower can’t sustain you long term
    *   Resisting negative cues in your environment is very fatiguing
*   For _negative_ habits (stuff you want to _stop_ doing; “habits of avoidance”), do the opposite:
    *   E.g., make it _non_\-obvious—don’t tempt yourself by seeing it!
    *   A few approaches to making the negative habit satisfying:
        *   Replace the bad habit with a good one
            *   This is important: you need _some_ sort of reward for doing the new thing
            *   It still needs to satisfy the same craving that you used to have
            *   It can’t _just_ be about having willpower to resist doing the original thing
        *   Increase the friction massively to do the bad thing (remove the exposure to trigger yourself)
        *   Make “doing nothing” more satisfying than doing the bad thing
            *   E.g., instead of buying a coffee, every time you were going to buy one, put $5 in a savings account
            *   Gives you a benefit for when “nothing happens”
*   For big, important, key areas of your life, you can start by making the habit really easy (and basic), and make it successively more difficult to get the “reward”
    *   E.g., start with 1 minute of working out a day, scale up to 30 mins or whatever
    *   Only applies to areas you want to be truly great
    *   For most things, good enough is good enough (it’s not worth being the best flosser ever)
*   Reaching more abstract goals (e.g., write 25 blog posts this year) by shaping your habits
    *   The key is to make it \*feel\* immediate and concrete
    *   Give yourself a strong visual of your progress
        *   E.g., start with two bowls, one full of paper clips; each time you take the action, you move one paper clip over; your goal is to move all the paper clips from one jar to the next
        *   Habit trackers work the same way
            *   Putting an X on the calendar is satisfying
            *   Each X reminds you to do it again
*   Automatic habits (stuff you do without even being aware of it) can _lead to_ really important routines
    *   You want to make the first 2 minutes or so of your important routine effortless
    *   E.g., if I get home from work and put on my workout clothes, going to the gym becomes automatic and easy; but, if I have to make a conscious decision to put on my workout clothes, it might not happen at all
