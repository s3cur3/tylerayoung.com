These posts chronicle my work as I build my SaaS [SleepEasy](https://www.sleepeasy.app), a new take on website monitoring. Unlike other site monitors, SleepEasy is designed to be:

* Dead simple—no configuration needed, just drop in your domain.
* Way more capable than traditional uptime monitors—we check for broken links, test your login and signup, visually inspect page layouts, & much more.
* Guaranteed to never produce a false positive—a human confirms every alert before it goes to your team.
