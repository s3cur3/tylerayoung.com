üëã Hey there!

I‚Äôm Tyler Young.

I'm a product-focused developer who likes creating things that makes people‚Äôs lives better. I‚Äôve spent more than a decade in software working on soft-real time systems, including collaborative mapmaking, game dev, video streaming, and IoT command-and-control systems.

Today, I'm building a new take on website monitoring called [SleepEasy](https://www.sleepeasy.app) and doing contracting & consulting on the side. I blog about the behind-the-scenes stuff (tech choices, marketing, customer development, and more) in the [#BuildInPublic](/category/build-in-public/) category here.

In the past, I‚Äôve been fortunate to work on a handful of other interesting projects:

* [Felt](https://felt.com), an outrageously powerful tool for making maps on the internet. Our tech stack was Elixir, React, and Postgres, deployed on Render.
* [CBTea](https://www.cbtea.app), a Phoenix LiveView app that acts as a journal for a core exercise in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). See the announcement post [here](/2023/07/28/cbtea-release/).
* Symphony, a¬†SaaS made by¬†[Generac Grid Services](https://www.enbala.com)¬†(n√©e Enbala)¬†that helps energy utilities balance electricity production against demand. This was an Elixir back-end communicating with an Elm (‚ù§Ô∏è) front-end over GraphQL.
* [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com), an app that turns iPads and other mobile devices into extra monitors for your computer.
* The [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com) flight simulator. Among other things, I was solely responsible for the massive multiplayer implementation (both client- and server-side) that we shipped in 2020 on the mobile app. I was also responsible for the UI rewrite we did for X-Plane 11 on the desktop, and I‚Äôve worked on various pieces of the low-level platform integration (we run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android).
* A Mac photo browser called [Unbound](https://www.unboundapp.com/). When I took it over from the previous dev, it was in rough shape‚Äîit crashed if you looked at it wrong, it failed to display images correctly, and the marketing failed to explain why you would want to use the app. I spent a few months overhauling the marketing and fixing bugs, then finally started shipping new features. I also started transitioning the Objective-C codebase to Swift (and SwiftUI, where appropriate).
